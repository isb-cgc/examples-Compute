#ISB-CGC Compute Examples

This repo contains computational examples for use in conjunction with the ISB-CGC platform.

Current examples include how to run CWL workflows on a single VM, and how to use Grid Engine.  Additional examples will be added as new use-cases are defined and implemented.


* **Using CWL (Common Workflow Language)**
  *  **cwl-examples**: several examples of specific CWL workflows


* **Using Grid Engine**  
  *  **grid-engine**: instructions on using Elasticluster to create clusters of GCE VMs running Grid Engine.
