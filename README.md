#ISB-CGC Compute Examples

This repo contains computational examples for use in conjunction with the ISB-CGC platform.

There are currently three subdirectories, with more to be added as additional use-cases are defined and implemented:
*  cwl-deployment: instructions on how to get set up on a single GCE VM to run CWL workflows; 
*  cwl-examples: several examples of specific CWL workflows;
*  grid-engine: instructions on using Elasticluster to create clusters of GCE VMs running Grid Engine.
