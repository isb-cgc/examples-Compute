#ISB-CGC Grid Engine Example - Index BAM Files by Cohort

This example was based on the example [Run SAMtools to index BAM files in Cloud Storage](http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/use_cases/run_samtools_over_many_files/index.html) from the [Google Genomics documentation](http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).  Be sure to check out some of the other Google Genomics examples, as many of them may be easily adapted to work on your Grid Engine cluster.
