#ISB-CGC Single-Node CWL Workflow Examples

Each subdirectory contains the required code files for a particular CWL (Draft 2) example.  Example directories may include one or more CommandLineTool specifications, a Workflow specification, or both, as well as a JSON-formatted input parameters file for each.  For example, the SNAPR example directory contains a Workflow file (.cwl), a JSON-formatted input parameters file, and additional subdirectories for each CommandLineTool required by the Workflow.  Each CommandLineTool directory contains a CommandLineTool file (.cwl), and a JSON-formatted input parameters file.  For CommandLineTool examples nested below a Workflow, the JSON-formatted input parameters files are used for reference or testing purposes only, and are not processed by the outer Workflow.

Example directory structure:
```
workflow/
  workflow.cwl  (Workflow)
  workflow-inputs.json  (Workflow inputs)
  commandlinetool-1/
    commandlinetool-1.cwl  (CommandLineTool)
    commandlinetool-1-inputs.json  (CommandLineTool inputs, for reference/testing only)
  commandlinetool-2/
    commandlinetool-2.cwl  (CommandLineTool)
    commandlinetool-2-inputs.json  (CommandLineTool inputs, for reference/testing only)
  ...
```
In general, each CommandLineTool represents a single step in the outer Workflow.  For more information about the relationship between CommandLineTool and Workflow, see the [CWL (Draft 2) specification](http://common-workflow-language.github.io/draft-2/).

In order to run these examples on Google Compute Engine, you may use the deployment template located in [bioinformatics-pipelines/cwl-deployment](../cwl-deployment), which is preconfigured to run the examples.  Instructions for creating the deployment can be found in the README file in that directory.

Once you've created a GCE VM for the examples, ssh to it:
```
gcloud compute ssh <cwl-node-name>
```
Once you've created your GCE VM and ssh'ed to it, clone this repo into your home directory so that you can run the examples:
```
git clone https://github.com/isb-cgc/bioinformatics-pipelines.git
```
